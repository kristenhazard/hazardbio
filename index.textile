h3. watching:

<ul>
<li>NBA playoffs</li>
<li>Battlestar Gallactica</li>
<li>Friday Night Lights</li>
</ul>

  
h3. hearing:

Right now I'm really into the song "One Man Guy" by Rufus Wainwright.  I found out about this song while reading Nick Hornby's Songbook.  He's a great writer and I'm really into his writing about music and books.  I devoured his set of book reviews from the Believer magazine.  You can find those here.

h3. creating:

Currently all my creative energy is focused on making a new web site called timesarrow.  It's started out a Web 2.0 social networking site for book clubs.  The idea is to view all books chosen by the club in a timeline and interact with them as such.  I'll keep you posted as I launch various iterations.
