It's been a while since I used the Airport Utility. Today I went to add a Airport Express to my wireless network 
so that I could play ITunes on my Bose system wirelessly. When I tried to hardwire I got an awful buzzing sound,
so I decided to try it wirelessly. 

The problem:
When I opened up Airport Utility I got:

You can't open the application "AirPort Utility" because it is not supported on this architecture.

I believe this happened as a result of Leopard install, but I'm not sure because it's been so long since
I actually opened up the Airport Utility.

The solution:
Go here and install the latest Airport Utility.
