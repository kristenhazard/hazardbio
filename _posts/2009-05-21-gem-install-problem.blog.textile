Error: could not find gem mislav-hanna locally or in a repository

My solution to this problem was found at "http://gems.github.com/":http://gems.github.com/

When I got this error my gem source was only set to:

<code>http://gems.rubyforge.org/</code>

But the gem I was trying to install was housed on github.  So I just needed to add github as a gem source.

<code>$ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com</code>

To find out your gem sources type in

<code>$ gem sources</code>
