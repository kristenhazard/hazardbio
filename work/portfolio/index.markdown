##Strategic Merchandising Partners
Over a period of 5 years I led a small group of developers building software to support a 
merchandising company that was experiencing rapid growth. This image summarizes the components we built.

The technology we utilized:

- .NET/C#
- SQL Server
- Crystal Reports followed by Microsoft Reporting Services


###Staffing
Recruiting field reps provided a interesting challenge because the rep job had such high turnover.  We built
functionality to allow reps to apply for opening.  Field management would then use the software to match applicants with 
open routes.  In addition we built a scheduling component that would let multiple reps request to fill openings
and field management could choose the best rep based on a ratings provided by the software.

###Accounting - Payout, Invoicing, Overtime Tracking
To support the accounting department we built a complete payout and invoicing system. Program management 
would setup the payout parameters. Field management would modify and approve the payout for their region.  
Accounting would then run the payout and the system would integrate with ADP for employes and QuickBooks 
for Independent Contractors. Reps could also download their pay stubs from the web site.

We built a page to track employee overtime issues.

###Dispatch
Some of our clients required us to dispatch reps to fix machines within 2 hours of a call from our client.  
For this we built a dispatch portal on top of our issue tracker.

###Issue Tracker
We built an issue tracker that integrated tightly with all of our other systems and allowed customers to also
interact with the issues.

###Quality Assurance
In order to ensure quality results to our clients we built pages to review and compare rep answers with shipping information.

###Photo Upload, Management and Gallery
Reps uploaded photos, management would approve photos and the client could view them on their client portal.

###Portals For Each Type of User
Eight different portals for distinct types of users.  Each with focused reporting and task management for 
that user.

###Reporting
The first module we built was a reporting system. At first we utilized Crystal Reports, then we migrated 
to Microsoft Reporting Services.  Clients had access to their reports via a client portal.
