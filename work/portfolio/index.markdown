##Strategic Merchandising Partners
Over a period of 5 years I led a small group of developers building software to support a 
merchandising company that was experiencing rapid growth.  The technology we utilized:

- .NET/C#
- SQLServer
- Crystal Reports followed by Microsoft Reporting Services

###Reporting
The first module we built was a reporting system. At first we utilized Crystal Reports, then we migrated 
to Microsoft Reporting Services.  Clients had access to their reports via a client portal.

###Portals For Each Type of User

###HR/Recruiting
Recruiting field reps provided a interesting challenge because the rep job had such high turnover.  We built
functionality to allow reps to apply.  Field management would then use the software to match applicants with 
open routes.

###Dispatch
Some of our clients required us to dispatch reps to fix machines within 2 hours of a call from our client.  
For this we built a dispatch portal on top of our issue tracker.

###Issue Tracker

###Quality Assurance
In order to ensure quality results to our clients we built pages to review and compare rep answers with shipping information.

###Photo Upload, Management and Gallery
Reps uploaded photos, management would approve photos and the client could view them on their client portal.

###Accounting - Payout, Invoicing, Overtime Tracking
To support the accounting department we built a complete payout and invoicing system.

Field management would approve the payout for their region.  Accounting would then run the payout 
and integrate with ADP for employes and QuickBooks for ICs.

We built a page to track employee overtime issues.

- EDI
- UPS Shipping Information
- Quick Books
