I meandered my way to programming.  I started out as a Mechanical Engineer, but never really got the 
mechanics side of things.  Then I gravitated toward Law School which I really enjoyed. While awaiting my 
Bar Exam results I picked up a programming job during the hey day of bubble 1.0.  To my surprise I really loved it. 
I've been programming every since.  It's been about 10 years now.  

* I started out in the dreaded proprietary technology building web based workflow applications for health 
insurance companies (5 years). 

* I then moved to .NET and C# building all kinds of needed applications for a small and growing merchandising 
company (another 5 years).  

* After that gig ended I took some time off to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails and build some applications 
I've been thinking about over the years.  That's where I am right now. Check out [timesarrow](http://times-arrow.com) to see one of those applications.
