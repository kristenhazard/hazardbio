### summary:
Do you need help implementing a small to medium size web application? I can help you.  Please contact me at: <span class="emailinline"><a href="mailto:kristen@hazardbio.com">kristen[at]hazardbio[dot]com</a></span>. 

* I specialize in working with small to medium size companies building web applications to suit their needs.
* I am very good at working with the end user to gather business requirements and turning those requirements into useful software.
* I work in small iterative development cycles to make sure the right software is delivered on time.
* I have been building web applications for the last 10 years and have a mixed skill set which allows me to be both the analyst and the programmer.


### history:

I meandered my way into my programming career. After graduating as a Mechanical Engineer and working in Silicon Valley during Bubble 1.0, I gravitated toward Law School which I really enjoyed. While in Law School I supported myself by programming. Then while awaiting my Bar Exam results (which I passed) I picked up a web application programming job during the hey day of Bubble 2.0. To my surprise I really loved it. I've been programming every since which is about 10 years now.

* I started out in the dreaded proprietary technology building web based workflow applications for health 
insurance companies (5 years). The technology was similar to ASP. It's where I learned to code. I quickly moved into managing projects because I'm good
with people.
* I then moved to .NET, C# and SQL Server building a suite of applications for a small and growing merchandising 
company (another 5 years).  
* After that gig ended I took some time off to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails and build web applications 
that are close to my heart.  That's where I am right now. Check out [timesarrow](http://times-arrow.com) to see one of those applications.
