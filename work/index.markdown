### summary:
Do you need help implementing a small to medium size web application? 

I'm available to hire as a consultant: <span class="emailinline">kristen[at]hazardbio.com</span>.

* I specialize in working with small to medium size companies building web application to suit their needs.
* I am very good at working with the end user gathering business requirements and turning those into useful software.
* I work in small iterative development cycles to make sure the right software is delivered on time.


### history:

I meandered my way to my programming career. I started out as a Mechanical Engineer but I never really understood the mechanical parts of Mechanical Engineering.  I then gravitated toward Law School which I really enjoyed. While awaiting my Bar Exam results (which I passed) I picked up a programming job during the hey day of Bubble 2.0. To my surprise I really loved it and I've been programming every since. It's been about 10 years now.

* I started out in the dreaded proprietary technology building web based workflow applications for health 
insurance companies (5 years). It's where I learned to code and I also did a lot of managing of clients and developers.
* I then moved to .NET and C# building all kinds of applications for a small and growing merchandising 
company (another 5 years).  
* After that gig ended I took some time off to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails and build some applications 
that are close to my heart.  That's where I am right now. Check out [timesarrow](http://times-arrow.com) to see one of those applications.
